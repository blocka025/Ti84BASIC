# Ti84BASIC

These are old files that I wrote on my TI84 calculator in high school. This was before any formal training, and most of these programs exist to reduce tedious algebraic calculators by replacing it with learning the antiquated and underpowered programming language that is TI BASIC.
There is a found place in my heart for many of these files. Some of the files that I am most proud of is my working solitare, blackjack, and chess that all works with the simple display of the TI84 Plus CE.
